# airbnb-clone-project

## Team Roles

- Backend Developer
- Database Administrator

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are integrated smoothly and delivered quickly, improving code quality and reducing manual errors. For this project, CI/CD pipelines help maintain a reliable and efficient development workflow.

Common tools for implementing CI/CD pipelines include:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying code directly from GitHub repositories.
- **Docker**: Packages applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server for building and deploying software.
- **Travis CI**: A continuous integration service for building and testing projects hosted on GitHub.

These tools help

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to protect the application and its users. The following key security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only verified users can access the API, protecting user accounts and personal data.
- **Authorization**: Restricts access to specific resources or actions based on user roles, preventing unauthorized operations such as editing listings or accessing admin features.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make, helping to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Checks and sanitizes all incoming data to prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **HTTPS**: Encrypts all data transmitted between clients and the server, protecting sensitive information from interception.

Security is crucial for:

- **Protecting User Data**: Prevents unauthorized access to personal and financial information.
- **Securing Payments**: Ensures that payment transactions are safe from fraud and theft.
- **Maintaining Platform Trust**: Builds user confidence and helps comply with legal and regulatory standards.

These measures help keep the platform safe, reliable, and trustworthy for all users.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure access and personalized experiences for each user.

- **Property Management**: Enables hosts to list, update, and remove properties. Hosts can add descriptions, photos, and pricing, making it easy to manage rental offerings.

- **Booking System**: Lets guests search for available properties, make reservations, and view booking history. This streamlines the process of finding and booking accommodations.

- **Review and Rating System**: Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This helps maintain quality and builds trust within the community.

- **Payment Integration**: Facilitates secure online payments for bookings. This ensures a smooth and safe transaction process for both guests and hosts.

- **Search and Filtering**: Provides advanced search and filtering options based on location, price, amenities, and availability. This helps users quickly find properties that meet their needs.

Each feature is designed to create a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for both guests and hosts, closely mirroring the core functionality

## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone project will include the following key entities:

- **Users**
  - Fields: id, name, email, password, role (guest/host)
  - Description: Represents all users of the platform. A user can be a guest, a host, or both.
- **Properties**
  - Fields: id, title, description, address, host_id
  - Description: Represents rental properties listed by hosts. Each property is owned by a user (host).
- **Bookings**
  - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status
  - Description: Represents reservations made by guests for properties. Each booking links a user to a property.
- **Reviews**
  - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment
  - Description: Allows users to leave feedback on properties they have booked.
- **Payments**
  - Fields: id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, status
  - Description: Records payment transactions for bookings.

**Entity Relationships:**

- A user (host) can have multiple properties.
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- A booking belongs to one user (guest) and one property.
- A review is linked to one user and one property.
- A payment is associated with one booking.
